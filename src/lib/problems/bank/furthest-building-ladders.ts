  description: `You are given an integer array \`heights\` representing the heights of buildings, some \`bricks\`, and some \`ladders\`.

You start your journey from building \`0\` and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.

While moving from building \`i\` to building \`i+1\` (**0-indexed**):
- If the current building's height is **greater than or equal** to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks.
- If the current building's height is **less than** the next building's height, you can either use **one ladder** or \`(h[i+1] - h[i])\` **bricks**.

Return the **furthest building index** (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.`,
